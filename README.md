# Civic Connect

**Multi-City Civic Issue Reporting and Resolution Platform**

> Simple. Transparent. Accountable.

Civic Connect bridges the gap between citizens and municipal authorities. Citizens report local infrastructure problems — potholes, garbage accumulation, water overflow, broken streetlights — with photo evidence and GPS location. Reports are automatically routed to the correct government department, tracked transparently, and escalated automatically if left unresolved beyond 7 days.

---

## Problem Statement

Urban infrastructure maintenance in Indian cities suffers from a fundamental disconnect between citizens who observe problems daily and municipal authorities responsible for resolving them. Existing grievance systems are fragmented, offer no transparency, and have zero accountability mechanisms.

| Problem | Impact |
|---|---|
| No structured reporting channel | Citizens resort to social media with no tracking |
| Duplicate complaints | Departments waste triage time on the same issue |
| No status transparency | Citizens cannot tell if their report was received or ignored |
| No escalation mechanism | Issues remain unresolved indefinitely |
| No proof of resolution | Departments close tickets without evidence |
| Fragmented data | Administrators have no city-wide visibility |

Civic Connect solves all of the above in a single platform with four user roles — **Guest**, **Citizen**, **Department**, and **Municipal Administrator** — each with isolated, purpose-built workflows.

```

**Key architectural decisions:**
- City isolation is enforced at the **middleware level** on every authenticated API route — not just the UI. A department user cannot query data from another city or department.
- **PostGIS `ST_DWithin`** powers 20-metre radius duplicate detection. When a new issue matches an existing one by category within 20 metres, it is linked to the existing consolidated ticket rather than creating a new one.
- **Socket.IO rooms** (`user:<id>`) enable targeted real-time push to individual users, department staff, or city-wide municipal admins without broadcasting to everyone.
- The **escalation cron job** runs daily and automatically flags any unresolved ticket older than 7 days, notifying the municipal admin — this cannot be suppressed by department staff.

## Running Locally

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+
- npm
- A Supabase project with PostGIS enabled
- A Cloudinary account
- A Gmail account with App Password enabled

---

### Backend Setup

1. Clone the repository and navigate to the backend directory:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/AtharvaChaudharii/civic-connect.git
cd civic-connect/backend
```

2. Install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

3. Create a `.env` file in the backend root and fill in the values:

```dotenv
PORT=5001
NODE_ENV=development

# Supabase PostgreSQL connection strings
DATABASE_URL=
DIRECT_URL=

# JWT
JWT_SECRET=
JWT_EXPIRES_IN=7d

# Frontend URL (for CORS)
FRONTEND_URL=https://civic-connect.live

# File upload limit (5 MB in bytes)
MAX_FILE_SIZE=5242880

# Cloudinary
CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME=
CLOUDINARY_API_KEY=
CLOUDINARY_API_SECRET=

# Gmail SMTP (use App Password, not your account password)
GMAIL_USER=
GMAIL_APP_PASSWORD=
```

4. Run Prisma migrations:

```bash
npx prisma migrate dev
npx prisma generate
```

5. Seed the database:

```bash
npx prisma db seed
```

6. Start the backend server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

The backend will start on `http://localhost:5001`.

---

### Frontend Setup

1. Navigate to the frontend directory:

```bash
cd civic-connect/frontend
```

2. Install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

3. For local development the API URL defaults to `localhost:5001`. If you need to point to a remote backend, create a `.env.production` file:

```dotenv
# Required for Vercel/Netlify deployment — also set this in the hosting dashboard
VITE_API_URL=https://your-backend-url.onrender.com
```

4. Start the frontend development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

The frontend will start on `http://localhost:5173`.

## User Roles

| Role | Access |
|---|---|
| **Guest** | Landing page, Quick Report (email only, no account needed) |
| **Citizen** | Dashboard, Report Issue, Issue Detail, Search, Profile, Notifications |
| **Department** | Department Dashboard, Ticket Detail, Performance Analytics, Notifications |

## Key Features

- **20-metre duplicate detection** via PostGIS — same category issues within 20 metres are merged into one ticket
- **Mandatory proof upload** — departments cannot mark a ticket resolved without uploading a photo
- **7-day auto-escalation** — cron job flags all unresolved tickets older than 7 days and notifies the municipal admin
- **Real-time updates** — Socket.IO pushes status changes, comments, and escalations live to all relevant users
- **Guest reporting** — no account required; guest receives email updates on their issue
- **Role-isolated API** — city and department scoping enforced at middleware level on every route
- **CSV export** — municipal admins can export department-wise issue reports
